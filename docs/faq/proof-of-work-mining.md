# :fa-fire: Proof-of-work Mining

---

#### 1. How long does it take for mined coins to get to my wallet? 

The coinbase maturity is 256 blocks. That means the coins will not show up as spendable for that many blocks.

---

#### 2. How do I find out which block I mined? 

There will be an entry in the `hcd` log that looks something like:

```no-highlight
Accepted block 000... via getwork.
```
