## Welcome To HC 

Welcome to HC! We are very glad to have you. As you may or may not already know, HC is different. There's a lot of new things to learn to fully grasp how things work. This documentation will attempt to make things a bit easier to understand.

This beginner's guide is a path to getting the HC software up and running. You can choose from multiple clients to get a node on the network and HC in your wallet. Specifically, you'll learn how to install, setup, and use the HC applications; how to obtain hc; how to vote via Proof-of-Stake; and how to use the block explorer.

You'll need to follow an [Installation Guide](#installation-guides), and then follow the path for the application of your choice below. After your application is set-up, go through the [General Guides](#general-guides) at the bottom of this page. If you have any questions along the way, join us in our [Slack](/support-directory.md#join-us-on-slack).

**NOTE: Using Testnet is highly recommended for learning how to use the HC software without the fear of making a mistake and losing real money. After following the guides to setup your choice of software, please visit the [Using Testnet guide](/getting-started/using-testnet.md) to learn how to launch your application onto HC's testnet.**

## Applications 

Below you'll find a list of currently available applications, with a chart showing their compatibility with different operating systems.

* **hcGUI**: Cross-platform GUI client as of v1.1.1.

* **hcd**: The node daemon, this command-line application handles block management and consensus.

* **hcwallet**: The wallet daemon, this command-line application handles address and transaction management.

* **hcctl**: The remote procedure call (RPC) client, this command-line application is used to control hcd and hcwallet via RPC commands.

|           | hcd | hcwallet | hcctl | hcGUI  |
| ---------:|:----:|:---------:|:------:|:-----------:|
| Windows   | X    | X         | X      | X           |
| macOS     | X    | X         | X      | X           |
| Linux     | X    | X         | X      | X           |
| Other UNIX| X    | X         | X      |             |

"Other UNIX" currently includes various *BSDs and Solaris/illumos.

Note: You might soon notice one of the many differences between HC and other 
popular cryptocurrencies: the wallet daemon and node daemon are separate.
A lot of other coins run these functions together in a single daemon.
For those who choose to use the command line interfaces, this means you must
run `hcd` for full node functionality, and `hcwallet` to store your hc,
create transactions and participate in Proof-of-Stake mining/voting.

## Installation Guides 

To get started, choose an option for installations available for your operating system below:

* [Command Line Suite **via hcinstall**](/getting-started/user-guides/cli-installation.md) - NOTE: The `hcinstall` method is the fastest and easiest way to get a command-line node and wallet running. It is recommended and the command-line path setup guides below will assume you've used this method.
* [hcGUI](/getting-started/user-guides/hcGUI-setup.md)

**NOTE:** All of the following guides can be found in the navigation menu with the same names.
